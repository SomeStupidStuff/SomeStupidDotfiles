## Editors

I have two main text editors that I switch between every few months. Firstly, there is `vim` which I would probably say is my main editor and also the one I put the most time into configuring. The other one is `emacs` (with evil bindings) which I have been getting back into because of the lack of plugins I have in my vim config. While I do also have a `neovim` configuration, I don't really use it quite often.

* Commit frequency: **High**

## Pythonrc

The pythonrc file is for my python config. It features a custom pretty print function and some other cools commands. I do have plans of adding history files and such in the future.

* Commit frequency: **Medium**

## Terminals

Although I don't actually use URxvt anymore, I still keep it around just in case. The terminal emulator that I mainly use is `alacritty`.

* Commit frequency: **Low**

## Shell

My terminal shell of choice is `zsh`. To be quite honest, though, I probably might not need all of the features it offers.

* Commit frequency: **Low**

## Bars

I do not use `yabar` or `tint2` anymore at the time of writing this. I am currently using `polybar` and have no plans to switch.

* Commit frequency: **Low**

## Compositor

I use `compton` as a compositor for my window manager. I probably should download `picom`, but if it isn't broken I won't fix it.

* Commit frequency: **Low**

## Window Manager

For my window manager, I use `i3`. It's a tiling window manager and I've customized it pretty much all that I want to.

* Commit frequency: **Medium**

## Notifications

For my notification daemon, I use `dunst`.

* Commit frequency: **Low**

## Application Launcher

For my application launcher, I use `rofi`. I might change some colors in the future to fit the rest of my theme.

* Commit frequency: **Low**
