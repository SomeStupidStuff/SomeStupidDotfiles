# SomeStupidDotfiles
Just some of my random dotfiles.
I'm mainly just using this for backups

Anyone is welcome to use them for whatever, but I don't promise anything great

I use vim, nvim, emacs26

Emacs.d is just spacemacs with a few tweaks specifically for me
Emacs.d.alt is an alternative if spacemacs gets too noisy

My vimrc is just the basic version of [this repo](https://github.com/amix/vimrc)
My nvim init.el is pretty basic and self explanatory
Vim themes are a tweaked [simple-dark](https://github.com/zefei/simple-dark) and [desert](https://github.com/fugalh/desert.vim)

My terminal is [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
My alacritty config is just the gruvbox theme but slightly tweaked

I use i3 as my window manager
The config is almost untouched except the removal of i3bar and the window titles

Zshrc just has some quality of life aliases
