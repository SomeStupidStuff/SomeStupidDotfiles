Dotfiles used for backup

Emacs.d is just spacemacs with a few tweaks specifically for me
Emacs.d.alt is an alternative if spacemacs gets too noisy

Vimrc is just the basic version of [this repo](https://github.com/amix/vimrc)
Nvim init.el is pretty basic and self explanatory
Vim themes are a tweaked [simple-dark](https://github.com/zefei/simple-dark) and [desert](https://github.com/fugalh/desert.vim)

Terminal is [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
Alacritty config is just the gruvbox theme but slightly tweaked

i3 window manager
The config is almost untouched except the removal of i3bar and the window titles

Zshrc just has some quality of life aliases
