Dotfiles used for backup

Emacs.d is my main editor config for emacs

Vimrc is kind of dirty but is readable
Nvim looks beautiful but you may need to reinstall vim-plug to port to other systems

Terminal is [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
Alacritty config is based on gruvbox but is tweaked for more vibrant colors

i3 window manager
Config has some keybindings for applications (ex. rofi) and uses tint2 an an i3bar ~~yabar as an i3bar~~

Zshrc just has some quality of life aliases
