# SomeStupidDotfiles
Dotfiles used for backup

Emacs.d is my main editor config for emacs
Emacs.d.alt is just spacemacs with a few tweaks specifically for me

Vimrc is kind of dirty but is readable
Nvim looks beautiful but you may need to reinstall vim-plug to port to other systems

Terminal is [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
Alacritty config is based on gruvbox but is tweaked for more vibrant colors

i3 window manager
Config has some keybindings for applications (ex. rofi) and uses yabar as an i3bar

Zshrc just has some quality of life aliases
